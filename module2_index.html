  		HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

   		Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.

  		JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.The browser has an embedded engine called Java Engine System.
